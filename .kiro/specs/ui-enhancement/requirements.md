# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for enhancing the frontend UI/UX of ORA Speaker, an AI-powered video analysis platform. The goal is to modernize and refine the existing interface with a futuristic, premium aesthetic while maintaining all current functionality. This is a visual enhancement project that focuses on design, spacing, color palette, typography, animations, and responsiveness without adding new features or modifying backend logic.

The enhancement will transform the current interface into a polished, professional experience inspired by modern platforms like ChatGPT, Notion, Midjourney, and Vercel Dashboard, using a glassmorphism aesthetic with minimal gradients, consistent spacing, and adaptive light/dark mode support.
