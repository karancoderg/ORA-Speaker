# Resizable Sidebar Feature

## Overview
Added the ability to resize the feedback history sidebar by dragging a handle on the right edge.

## Implementation Details

### Features
1. **Drag-to-Resize**: Users can drag the right edge of the sidebar to adjust its width
2. **Width Constraints**: 
   - Minimum width: 240px
   - Maximum width: 480px
   - Default width: 256px (equivalent to Tailwind's w-64)
3. **Visual Feedback**: 
   - Hover indicator on the resize handle
   - Cursor changes to `col-resize` during dragging
   - Blue accent color on hover with grip icon
4. **Persistence**: Width is saved to localStorage and restored on page reload
5. **Desktop Only**: Resize handle only appears on desktop (lg breakpoint and above)

### Technical Implementation

#### State Management
```typescript
const [sidebarWidth, setSidebarWidth] = useState(DEFAULT_WIDTH);
const [isResizing, setIsResizing] = useState(false);
const sidebarRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
```

#### Resize Logic
- Mouse down on handle starts resize mode
- Mouse move updates width (constrained to MIN/MAX)
- Mouse up ends resize and saves to localStorage
- Prevents text selection and changes cursor during resize

#### Resize Handle
```typescript
<div
  className="hidden lg:block absolute top-0 right-0 w-1 h-full cursor-col-resize group hover:bg-blue-400/50 transition-colors"
  onMouseDown={handleResizeStart}
>
  <div className="absolute top-1/2 right-0 -translate-y-1/2 translate-x-1/2 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity">
    <div className="bg-blue-500/80 rounded-full p-1 shadow-lg">
      <GripVertical className="w-3 h-3 text-white" />
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### User Experience

#### Visual Indicators
- Thin vertical line on the right edge of sidebar
- On hover: Line becomes blue and grip icon appears
- During drag: Cursor changes to col-resize, sidebar width updates in real-time

#### Accessibility
- `role="separator"` for semantic meaning
- `aria-label="Resize sidebar"` for screen readers
- `aria-orientation="vertical"` to indicate resize direction

#### Persistence
- Width is saved to localStorage as `sidebarWidth`
- Automatically restored on next visit
- Falls back to default if saved value is invalid

### Mobile Behavior
- Resize handle is hidden on mobile (< lg breakpoint)
- Sidebar uses fixed width on mobile for consistent experience
- Mobile overlay and slide-in animation remain unchanged

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Users can adjust sidebar width to their preference
2. **Content Visibility**: Wider sidebar shows more of long video filenames
3. **Screen Real Estate**: Narrower sidebar provides more space for main content
4. **Personalization**: Width preference persists across sessions
5. **Smooth UX**: Real-time visual feedback during resize

## Code Changes

### Modified Files
- `components/Sidebar.tsx`

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

4. Animated width transitions when restoring from localStorage
5. Visual width indicator during resize (e.g., tooltip showing pixel width)
