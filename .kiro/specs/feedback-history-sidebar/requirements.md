# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds feedback history functionality to the dashboard sidebar, allowing users to view, navigate, and manage their past video analysis sessions. Users will be able to see a list of their previously analyzed videos in the sidebar, click to view specific feedback, and quickly access their analysis history without cluttering the main content area.

## Requirements

6. WHEN viewing the feedback list THEN the system SHALL use appropriate text sizing for readability within the sidebar width
7. WHEN viewing a long list THEN the system SHALL make the feedback section scrollable while keeping the sidebar header and footer fixed
